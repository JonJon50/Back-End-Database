# E-Commerce Database

## Description

This project involved creating a database and then using seed data to fill the database. After the database had info stored in it the user would be able to manipulate in any way they want by means of Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 

I HAVE learned to:

1. Connect routes to models
2. Create a database and tables inside the database. 
3. Link the database to mySQL
4. Use CRUD on a database 

### Built With

Insomnia, JavaScript, mySQL, Node.js, Sequelize, Express, DBeaver
